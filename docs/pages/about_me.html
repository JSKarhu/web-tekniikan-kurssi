               <p id="p_music">I am very passionate about music. In my spare time if i'm not listening to music, i'm either playing guitar/bass, or making my own music. I have been playing guitar for six years and have spend <span>too mutch</span> alot of money on guitars, amps and effect pedals. I have played in couple of bands with my friends, but most of the time i like to play on my own. My music taste varies alot based on my mood, and my playlists contain everything from death metal to pop and from ambiance to movie/game soundtracks.</p>
               <p id="p_gaming" class="hide">Playing games is also one of my passions. I started playing videogames when i was very young, and my love for gaming has stayed with me growing up. Videogames offer escape from stress and worries of normal life, and help you relax. I especially love games that captivate me with storytelling, interesting worlds and sountracks that help bring the world alive. Some of my favorite examples of this are: <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us">Last of Us</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II">Last of Us Part 2</a>. I dream to one day work as a part of a game studio, and help bring games like this to life.</p>
               <p id="p_outdoors" class="hide">One part of my daily routine is to take walks with my dog. One of the pros of owning a dog, is that you have to go outside, even if you would rather stay on the couch. It also forces you to keep a daily routine, and makes sure that you have to take breaks from working/playing. We go on walks at least thrice a day, and i usually listen to music or podcasts during the walks to pass the time.</p>
